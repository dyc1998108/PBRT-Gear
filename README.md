# PBRT-Gear 0.2.0
This is a simulation to run pbrt on city3. It contains downloading files and running pbrt renderings. The run.py is a Windows version while downloadAcq.py is a Mac/Linux version. In addition, newrun.py is a more general version on Linux/Mac os.
# How to run(for Linux/Mac version)
Just running downloadAcq.py with python3(flywheel sdk is prerequisite). You may also have a try on newrun.py!
# For Windows version
It's possible to run run.py on Windows, however it needs a lot of additional work due to the limitation of Windows, so it's not appropriate to try on Windows. However, if you must, you need to replace the city3 pbrt/json file by the version under 'city3' in this repository.
