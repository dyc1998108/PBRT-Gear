# PBRT-Gear 0.2.0
This is a simulation to run pbrt on city3. The run.py is a Windows version while downloadAcq.py is a Mac/Linux/Gear version.
# How to run(for Windows version)
# 1
Downloading run.py to a specific place.
# 2
Before you run the run.py, you need to copy all of the files under 'city3' in this repository(they are different from those already on flywheel) to the directory 'temporary'(or another name, if so, member to change the name in run.py as well), which you should have defined under the directory where run.py at before running this code.
# 3
Using Python3 to run run.py. This may takes a lot of time.
