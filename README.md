# PBRT-Gear 0.2.0
This is a simulation to run pbrt on city3.
# How to run
# 1
Before you run the run.py, you need to copy all of the files under 'city3' in this repository(they are different from those already on flywheel) to the directory 'temporary', which you should have defined under the directory where run.py at before running this code. 
# 2
After you done this, using Python3 to run run.py. 
# 3
Finally, under folder 'temporary', run 'pbrt city3_14_17_v10.0_f74.04left_o270.00_201962618446_pos_5000_5000_5000.pbrt result\renderings\city3_14_17_v10.0_f74.04left_o270.00_201962618446_pos_5000_5000_5000.dat' to start pbrt rendering.
